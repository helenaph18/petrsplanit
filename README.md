# Petr's Planit Hackathon Project
## By Helen Pham, Rochelle Nixon, Basma Bahia, and Anushka Cherian

Within 24 hours, our team of 4 created a working website that served as a planner for students, like ourselves, to help keep track of things they needed to do throughout the week. We utilized the following technologies: Python with flask, jinja, HTML, and CSS.
